Nmap scan report
----------------

Command used:
nmap -sC -sV <TARGET_IP>

Scan Summary:
Host is up (very low latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)

Open Ports:
22/tcp open ssh
    |-- Service: OpenSSH 10.2p1 Debian 2
    |-- Protocol: SSH (Secure Shell)
    |-- OS: Linux
    |-- CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Interpretation:
Port 22 is open and running an SSH server. SSH is used for secure remote login and secure file transfer. 
Since it's publicly accessible inside the local network, an attacker could attempt brute force or
version-based vulnerabilities if SSH is not properly configured.
